            <h3>Chinatown After Dark</h3>
            <p>Our flagship monthly arts and culture series transforms Chinatown into a vibrant public gathering place from May to September. Imagine Taste of Edmonton, taking place in a back alley in Chinatown, across 20+ local restaurants.</p>
            <p>CTAD brings together music, performances, interactive art, food, and local businesses — centering Asian, Indigenous, newcomer, youth, and 2SLGBTQ+ creatives in free, accessible public space. With thousands attending each season, CTAD challenges stigma and shows what Chinatown can feel like when community leads.</p>

            <p>Our monthly cleanups are one of the simplest — and most important — things we do.</p>
            <p>They’re not just about tidying streets. They’re about showing care for place, building pride, and creating low-barrier ways for people to show up for Chinatown together. Cleanups often end with shared meals and conversations that spark new ideas and relationships.</p>
            <p><strong>Join us:</strong><br/>10:45am on the <strong>2nd Saturday</strong> of each month<br/>Meet at <strong>CO*LAB</strong> (9641 102A Ave NW)</p>

            <p>Mahjong Nights are about slowing down and making space for connection across generations.</p>
            <p>By gathering around a familiar game, we create welcoming, culturally rooted environments where people can meet, learn, and spend time together — whether they’re longtime community members or brand new to Chinatown.</p>
            <p>Mahjong Nights are hosted at the <strong>Mah Society</strong> on the <strong>1st and 3rd Friday</strong> of every month, from <strong>6pm to late</strong>. Please bring a <strong>$5 cash donation</strong> — and come hungry. They feed us too.</p>

            <h3>Hope Stoves for Homies</h3>
            <p>Edmonton winters can be deadly, and shelter capacity is limited. Through <strong>Hope Stoves for Homies</strong>, we do what we can to support unhoused community members while also reducing neighbourhood fire risks.</p>
            <p>Hope Stoves are simple, low-cost heating solutions — large candles set in paint cans — that can be used for warmth and basic cooking. They are intentionally designed so that if tipped over, the wax extinguishes the flame, helping address safety concerns.</p>
            <p>During the winter months, we gather regularly to build and distribute Hope Stoves as a collective act of care — doing our best to help people stay warm, safe, and seen.</p>

    <h3>Chinatown Community Housing Development Initiative</h3>
    <p>We are working toward a long-term vision of <strong>community-owned, affordable housing</strong> in Chinatown. If we don’t lead our own development, it’s only a matter of time before we are up against displacement and gentrification.</p>
    <p>This initiative focuses on building local capacity, partnerships, and governance models that keep Chinatown affordable, culturally rooted, and community-led — ensuring that the people who bring life to the neighbourhood can continue to live, work, and belong here.</p>

    <p class="beliefs-intro">
      Our projects look different on the surface, but they are all grounded in the same shared beliefs:
    </p>

    <div class="belief-grid">
      <div class="belief">
        <h3>Everything we need is already here</h3>
        <p>We practice asset-based community development. Chinatown’s people, cultures, businesses, stories, and relationships are strengths to be nurtured.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="belief">
        <h3>Relationships are built through regular gathering</h3>
        <p>Belonging doesn’t happen once a year. High-frequency gatherings build trust, care, and shared ownership over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="belief">
        <h3>Diversity of thought is our strength</h3>
        <p>We lean into intercultural and intergenerational collaboration. When lived experiences meet with respect, better ideas emerge.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="belief">
        <h3>Big dreams require shared effort</h3>
        <p>We grow through partnerships. The bigger the vision, the bigger the team — artists, businesses, cultural groups, social agencies, and organizers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="belief">
        <h3>Community ownership is essential</h3>
        <p>Lasting vibrancy requires community control — over space, decision-making, and future direction — including long-term affordability.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="belief">
        <h3>Care and joy are radical practices</h3>
        <p>We ground our work in care, celebration, and joy. Choosing joy and mutual care is both intentional and transformative.</p>
